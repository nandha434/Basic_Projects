    story=f"""  There once was a king named {King_name} who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then {Verb} a wish by {Wisher}, the god of {God_name}.

    For his wish, {King_name} asked that whatever he touched would turn to {Metal}. Despite {Wisher}’ efforts to prevent it, {King_name} pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.

    Excited about his newly-earned powers, {King_name} started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure {Metal}.

    But soon, {King_name} became hungry. As he picked up a piece of {food}, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to {Metal} in his hand.

    Hungry, {King_name} groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”"""
